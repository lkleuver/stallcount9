::: PROGRAMMING
	
	AUTOLOADING
	Classes are autoloaded if you use the following convention:
	class name:  SC9_Controller_Home
	class file:  lib/SC9/Controller/Home.php
	
	ADDING MODELS
	edit the ./app/build/schema/base.yml file to add your model info.
	next run (from commandline)  php ./generate.php
	This will create (or update) your models in ./app/lib/SC9/Model
	These files are generated but can be committed.
